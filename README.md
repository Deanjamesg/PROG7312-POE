**3. Success Message:** If the user has successfully entered all the report form information and submitted the report, a successful toast message will be displayed on that page.

**4. Input Validation:** If the user has not filled in the necessary fields, the user will not be able to submit the form and beneath the fields will be error messages, informing the user of what needs to be filled in.

**5. View Reports:** Navigate to the report viewing page to see the reports you've submitted or the sample data that was pre-loaded. The data is only stored during the application's runtime.
